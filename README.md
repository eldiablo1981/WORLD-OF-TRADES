𝕋ℍ𝔼 𝕎𝕆ℝ𝕃𝔻 𝕆𝔽 𝕋ℝ𝔸𝔻𝔼𝕊

The goal here is to simply create 2 simple lists EASY to update, and to be able to search through this list. 

1️⃣ OPTION = List with games you have to trade (for the moment).

2️⃣ OPTION = List with all my GAMES collection (so that we can propose you a trade).

Displaying the results of the SEARCH in a list, that would be SUPER.


And what I can't do at all at the moment:
Be able to COMPARE 2 LISTS OF NAMES (TEXT), and display the NAMES (TEXT) that are missing in the other LIST.



That' s it, it's SIMPLE, but not on the net.

So now it's up to us.
Because I need your HELP  (っ◔◡◔)っ 💖
