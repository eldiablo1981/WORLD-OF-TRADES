The goal here is to simply create 2 simple lists EASY to update, and to be able to search through this list.<br> 

1 OPTION  = List with games you have to trade (for the moment).<br>
2 OPTION = List with all my GAMES collection (so that we can propose you a trade).<br>

Displaying the results of the SEARCH in a list, that would be SUPER.<br>
<br>

INFO<br>

NO PROGRAMS TO INSTALL. NOTHING<br>
You update by DRAG AND DROP with your internet browser.<br>
You just have to create an account and you will get your website directly.<br>
You don't believe me?<br>

And what I can't do at all at the moment:<br>
Be able to COMPARE 2 LISTS OF NAMES (TEXT), and display the NAMES (TEXT) that are missing in the other LIST.<br>
<br>
That' s it, it's SIMPLE, but not on the net.<br>
<br>
<br>
Just a little information:<br>
I already added my games and my data. But it will be very easy to modify them with yours.<br>
That's the GOAL<br>
<br>
<br>
So now it's up to us.<br>
Because I need your HELP  (っ◔◡◔)っ 💖
